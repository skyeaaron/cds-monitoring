Build Monitor Patient Data How-To Guide

This looks for all "concepts" that have ever been used with real patients.
It compares data in all patient charts through yesterday to the data in all patient charts through today.
It reports on records that were added for the first time today, or that were deleted from the database today.
Generally we expect most changes to be new additions, and relatively few changes to be deletions.
Since the database maintains a historical record of all orders, cancelling an order is not enough to delete it from the database.
Thus, for example, if this report shows a deleted medication, that usually means that the medication was removed entirely from the reference table and replaced with something else.

Medication Prescribed to Patients
This table reports on changes to Medication ID.
If a Medication ID was prescribed to a patient for the first time ever today (in comparison to whatever the historical record said yesterday), then there will be a line highlighted in green with a plus sign.
If a Medication ID has been removed from all historical order records and no longer appears anywhere in the patient data, then there will be a row in the table highlighted in red.
Other fields in the table report the name of the medication and the pharm class, pharm subclass, and generic dsc that the med rolls up under.
